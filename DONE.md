## Media Scan
OK - as soon as a tbl_Movies entry is written, also write Name

## @Mike

Analyze the call App.vue -> store.rescan(onlyNew); -> node functionality without IPC or whatever

## Other
OK - implement fetchFilter IMDB/Metacritic Score

OK - implement Company filter by Company Name instead of ID
OK -> call companyDialog via eventBus when company is clicked in searchDialog
  -> some numbers mismatch (filter and main list)

OK - MediaList: when changing a page, autoscroll up?

OK - Rescan: only 1 button on sidenav, show dialog to choose "only new" or "compete" rescan

OK - Trailer Player with Video.js (extract video source from imdb trailer page)
OK -> MediaList showTrailerLocal

OK - remember "sort by" setting (same as remembering the filters)
OK -> "sort by" is destroyed upon reload after adding/removing entry to a list

OK - Remove movie from list -> Reload -> List is unchecked (why?)
OK - filescan new fields:
OK - size (display humanized e.g. 13.5 GB, 760 MB)
OK - creation date

OK - bottom bar should adjust to sidenav (we have its z-index at 100 now)

OK - MultiPart: interpret "1_2" as "(1/2)"
OK - exit menuitem
OK - fix Age Rating filter (undetermined yields no results -> see filterParentalAdvisory)

OK - add "isExtraOf" relation for tbl_Movies
OK -> don't count Extras (e.g. in filters)
OK -> don't show Extras in main list
OK -> show Extras in expanded item
OK -> implement extra detection in rescan (determine to which movie the extra must be assigned to, e.g. multiple releases of the same movie, maybe work with IMDB id but also with parts of the Name)
